# FYP - University Final Year Project
This repository contains some examples of code from my final year project.

The project involves creating a tool using 1D CNNs to correct sensor data taken from a vehicle so that the data can be used for vehicle analysis. Most of the project is written in Python, with the final app being written in MATLAB.
